# Configuration
## 4.1 API Key Setup

Obtaining an API key from the Open Exchange Rates API and configuring it in the project is essential to authenticate requests made to the API. API keys act as unique identifiers that authenticate and authorize access to the API's services. Here's how you can set up an API key:

- **Obtain API Key:** Visit the Open Exchange Rates API website and sign up for an account. After registering, navigate to the API key section to generate a unique API key assigned to your account.

- **Configure API Key:** Once you've obtained the API key, configure it in your project. This typically involves storing the API key in a configuration file or environment variable that can be accessed by your application code. Ensure that the API key is kept secure and not exposed publicly to prevent unauthorized access to your account.

- **Usage:** With the API key configured in your project, you can include it in the headers or query parameters of your HTTP requests to the Open Exchange Rates API. This allows the API to authenticate and authorize your requests, enabling you to access the API's services and retrieve data such as currency exchange rates.

## 4.2 OrbitDB Configuration

OrbitDB is a decentralized database built on top of IPFS, providing a distributed and peer-to-peer method for storing and querying data. Configuring OrbitDB involves setting up various settings and options to customize its behavior. Here are some aspects of OrbitDB configuration:

- **Database Path:** Specify the path where OrbitDB will store its database files. This path should be accessible and writable by your application.

- **Replication Options:** Configure replication options to determine how data is replicated and distributed across the network. Replication options may include settings such as the number of peers to replicate data to, replication frequency, and replication strategy.

- **Access Control:** Define access control rules to restrict or grant access to the database. Access control settings may include authentication mechanisms, permissions, and encryption to ensure data security and privacy.

- **Database Schema:** Design the schema of your OrbitDB database, including the structure of documents, fields, and data types. Define how data is organized and indexed within the database to optimize querying and retrieval operations.
